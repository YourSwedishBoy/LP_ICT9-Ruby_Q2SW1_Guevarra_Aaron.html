                <td>Sidney Prescott was the girlfriend of Billy Loomis. I like her because unlike other protagonists in other horror movies who just run away, she tries to fight back even though her opponents are strong men, and there were two as well. She's smart compared to other horror movie characters whose goal is only to run away even though the killer has good agility and speed, they don't take advantage of what's around them unlike Sidney.</td>
